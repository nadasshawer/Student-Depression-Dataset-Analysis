#Skills: 
📊 Data Analysis · 🧼 Data Cleaning · 📈 Predictive Modeling · 📊 Power BI Visualization & Dashboards · 📊 Excel · 📉 Regression Analysis · 📐 Inferential Statistics · 🤝 Team Leadership

For my Intro to Business Analytics university course, I led and coordinated the end-to-end process, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to predictive modeling and visualization. I ensured alignment among team members by delegating tasks, setting deadlines, and facilitating collaborative problem-solving. My role also involved synthesizing insights from descriptive and inferential statistics to answer key research questions, such as identifying financial stress and study satisfaction as significant predictors of depression. For our data dashboard, I designed an interactive Power BI interface highlighting trends and actionable conclusions. The dashboard features dynamic filters, combo charts, and regression summaries to showcase analytical rigor and storytelling skills, emphasizing data-driven recommendations for mental health interventions.
